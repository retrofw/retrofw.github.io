RetroFW v2.1 is out with a new batch of bug fixes. It brings more stability, improvements and also features for the developers. Just in time to show your valentine how much you love them!

It also brings us cool new features like the fastest file browsing ever, ~~libopk and opkrun tools~~, default CPU speed of 600MHz, faster debugging loops with better log file management, and too many small tweaks to mention!

### [2019-12-27: RetroFW 2.0 patch 001 (vfat-lower)](https://github.com/retrofw/retrofw.github.io/releases/download/2.0/patch-2.0-001-vfat-lower.ipk)
This little patch rollbacks a change we made to VFAT mounting options (from "lower" to "mixed"). We're rolling it back because, in combination with a Windows copy bug, it caused FBA and NeoGeo ROMS not to be recognized by emulators when put in internal SD. Just install it from Explorer like a normal IPK.
